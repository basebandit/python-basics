def sum(*args):

# Note that args is just a name. Youâ€™re not required to use the name args.
# You can choose any name that you prefer, such as integers:


def sum2(*integers):
    result = 0
    for x in integers:
        result += x
    return result


print(sum2(1))  # 1
print(sum2(3, 4, 5, 7, 8))  # 27

# The above function still works, even if you pass the iterable object as integers
# instead of args. All that matters here is that you use the unpacking operator (*).
